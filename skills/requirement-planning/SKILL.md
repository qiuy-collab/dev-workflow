description: Use structured dialogue to guide users in refining project requirements, output a requirements list, user flow, and feature priority draft

# Requirement Planning

## Task Goals

- This Skill converts a user's project idea into a structured requirements document
- Capabilities include guided requirement discovery, requirements list organization, user flow design, and feature priority ranking
- Trigger conditions: user expresses a project idea but lacks complete requirements (e.g., "I want to build an X app", "I have a new idea")
- Change trigger: when the user adds/removes/changes features, adjusts priority, or changes the tech stack, enter “requirements change mode”

## Mandatory Gate (Must Ask First)

- `autoMode` applies only to **between-Skill** progression. It must not skip any mandatory sub-steps inside this Skill.
- If an external prompt says “do not ask questions,” this Skill must still execute mandatory questioning and confirmation loops.
- Do not generate final requirement outputs before requirements collection is complete
- After entering this Skill, the first round must ask questions; do not output a full document immediately
- Questions must cover at least 5 dimensions: project goals, core features, user scenarios, tech stack, constraints
- Acceptance criteria are auto-generated by the Agent based on templates; do not ask the user
- If the user provides only a single sentence (insufficient info), continue asking and do not auto-fill then output
- Only when one of the following is true may you generate documents:
  - Key information has been fully collected
  - The user explicitly confirms “output with current information, missing items to be filled later”
- If the user says “continue / generate directly” but key info is missing, return the missing list and continue asking
- Even when `workflow.autoMode=true`, this Skill must complete mandatory questioning and confirmations before moving to the next Skill.
- Auto execution inside this Skill is prohibited for mandatory sub-steps (`Step 1`, `Step 1.5`, `Step 1.6`).

## Discussion Framework

### Phase 1: Requirements Collection

Guide the user across these dimensions:

1. **Project background and goals**: problem to solve, target users, core value
2. **Core features**: must-have features (at least 3-5)
3. **User scenarios**: typical scenarios and pain points
4. **Tech stack selection**: backend language, web framework, database, frontend framework
5. **Constraints**: time, resources, other limits
6. **Expected outcomes**: success metrics (auto-generated by Agent, not asked)

### Phase 2: Requirements Confirmation

Confirm the following key information with the user:

- Feature boundaries (what not to build)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, availability)
- User roles and permissions
- Integration needs (third-party systems, APIs)
- Tech stack confirmation

### Phase 3: Output Organization

Based on collected information, generate:

1. Requirements list (including tech stack)
2. User flow
3. Feature priority draft

## Operational Steps

### Step 1: Requirements Collection

- Ask the user about the core idea and goals
- Use the discussion framework to refine details
- Record key requirements and constraints
- Mandatory: ask **all 5 core question groups (Q1-Q5)** before Step 1.5.
- Mandatory: each question group must use `option-select + custom answer`.
  - User may choose options, provide custom text, or combine both.
- Prohibited: merging Q1-Q5 into a single short card (e.g., only 2-3 questions).
- **Functional supplements must be embedded in the questions**:
  - After the user states initial core features, immediately ask option-select follow-ups to expand missing functions.
  - Use “choose + optional custom” format so the user can select or add missing items.

Fixed core question groups:
- Q1 Project goals and target users
- Q2 Core features (3-5 must-have)
- Q3 User scenarios and key interactions
- Q4 Tech stack selection
- Q5 Constraints (time/resources/budget/risk)

Example option-select prompts (adapt to the product domain):

- **Account & Identity**: `no login / phone login / account-password / third-party / other`
- **Content/Conversation Organization**: `single session / multi-session list / folders-tags / other`
- **Message/Content Capabilities**: `text only / text+image / text+file / voice input / other`
- **Model/API Mode**: `fixed model / switchable model / per-session model / other`
- **System Prompt/Role**: `none / configurable system prompt / preset roles / other`
- **Management Actions**: `rename / delete / pin / search / export / other`
- **Item Actions**: `copy / resend / quote / edit / feedback / other`
- **Error & Retry**: `auto retry / manual retry / show reason / other`
- **Billing/Quota**: `no display / show quota / subscription / pay-per-use / other`
- **Platforms/Sync**: `web only / web+mobile / multi-device sync / offline drafts / other`

Rules:

- Use the above as a **template** and replace categories based on the user’s product.
- Summarize selected items and confirm before moving forward.
- If any of Q1-Q5 is incomplete, continue asking and do not generate output documents.

### Step 1.5: Completeness Check (Required Before Document Generation)

- Validate completeness against the 5 dimensions
- Output “confirmed information” and “missing information list”
- If missing items exist, continue asking and do not proceed to Step 2
- If the user explicitly authorizes “output with current info,” mark “to-be-confirmed” items in the document, then proceed to Step 2

### Step 1.6: UI Visualization and Confirmation (Mandatory, Iterative)

After requirements are collected and confirmed, execute the following three forced stages.
Each stage requires explicit user confirmation before moving to the next stage or any next Skill.

1. **Generate page list**
  - Derive pages from the confirmed requirements and user flow.
2. **Generate per-page ASCII component visualization**
  - Use [references/ui-component-ascii-template.md](references/ui-component-ascii-template.md).
  - Present one ASCII wireframe per page.
3. **Confirm component positions (forced)**
  - Ask the user to confirm positions or request changes.
  - If not confirmed, iterate and regenerate until confirmed.
4. **Confirm UI style (forced)**
  - Ask the user to confirm style using candidates sourced from `ui-ux-pro-max-local` data files (do not ask with ad-hoc style labels only).
  - Data source priority:
  1. &nbsp;（来源: styles/colors/typography）
  2. &nbsp;（来源: styles/colors/typography）
  3. &nbsp;（来源: styles/colors/typography）
  4. &nbsp;（来源: styles/colors/typography，可选）
  5. 其他（请自定义描述）
    格式：直接回复编号（可多选，如 1,3），或回复“5 + 自定义风格描述”。
    `If the user chooses multiple options, summarize and ask one confirmation question:`text
    择的是：&nbsp;。请回复“确认”或提出修改。
    `If the user picks`5`, keep asking until a concrete custom style description is confirmed.
5. **Generate requirement-stage UI drafts (forced)**
  - After stage 1-4 are confirmed, generate:
    - `output/ui/ui-spec.md` (draft)
    - `output/ui/ui-tokens.json` (draft)
    - `output/ui/ui-quality-metrics.md` (draft)
  - Mark these as draft artifacts that will be refined by `ui-ux-pro-max-local`.

Note: These stages are mandatory. Do not proceed to Step 2 (document output) or any next Skill until all are explicitly confirmed.

### Step 2: Generate Requirements List

- Only execute after Step 1 and Step 1.5 pass
- Follow the format in [references/requirements-template.md](references/requirements-template.md)
- Organize by feature module or user story
- Include requirement description, priority, acceptance criteria
- **Record tech stack**: backend language, framework, database, frontend framework

### Step 3: Design User Flow

- Follow the format in [references/userflow-template.md](references/userflow-template.md)
- Describe key user paths and interaction flows
- Mark exception handling and branch logic

### Step 4: Define Feature Priority

- Follow the framework in [references/priority-framework.md](references/priority-framework.md)
- Use MoSCoW or RICE scoring to prioritize
- Distinguish MVP, short-term goals, and long-term planning

### Step 5: Output and Confirmation

- Combine the three documents into a complete requirements plan
- Request user confirmation and feedback
- Adjust based on feedback
- Ensure draft UI artifacts are output:
  - `output/ui/ui-spec.md`
  - `output/ui/ui-tokens.json`
  - `output/ui/ui-quality-metrics.md`

### Step 6: Requirements Change Mode (Incremental Sync)

- Identify change type: add, remove, modify, priority change, tech stack change
- Generate an “impacted documents list,” and require updating output docs first
- Check at least the following docs for impact:
  - `output/requirement-planning-requirements.md`
  - `output/requirement-planning-tech-stack.json` (when tech stack changes)
  - `output/api-design-api-list.md`
  - `output/api-design-data-models.md`
  - `output/api-design-api-documentation.md`
  - `output/backend-codegen-project-structure.md`
- After syncing docs, guide into subsequent Skill execution: code changes -> tests -> logging

## Notes

- Keep the dialogue guided; avoid asking too many questions at once
- In requirements collection, you must ask and record tech stack selection
- Do not output a full requirements document before collection is complete
- Tech stack info is passed to later API design and code generation
- Focus on user needs rather than implementation details
- Prioritization should be based on business value and user impact
- Requirements should be clear and testable, avoiding ambiguity
- When requirements change, update impacted output docs first before code changes
- UI visualization and confirmation is mandatory and blocks next Skill until confirmed
- UI style selection must be confirmed before generating final requirements outputs
- UI style questions must be based on `ui-ux-pro-max-local/data/*` candidates, then confirmed by user
- Requirement-planning must output UI drafts (`output/ui/ui-spec.md`, `output/ui/ui-tokens.json`) after UI confirmation stages
- Requirement-planning must output UI quality metrics draft (`output/ui/ui-quality-metrics.md`) after UI confirmation stages
- `ui-ux-pro-max-local` refines these drafts into final implementation baseline
- Functional supplements must be embedded in questioning using option-select format to let users choose or add missing functions

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Mobile App Requirement Planning**

- User: "I want to build a fitness check-in app"
- Agent guidance: understand target users, core features (check-ins, stats, social), scenarios
- Output: complete requirements list, user registration and check-in flow, MVP priority

**Example 2: Enterprise System Requirement Planning**

- User: "We need an employee management system"
- Agent guidance: company size, employee roles, current workflows, integration needs
- Output: feature module split, approval flow design, phased rollout plan

## Additions (Aligned with agent.md)

1. When `workflow.forceQuestioningOnFirstSkill=true`, as the first Skill, this phase must ask questions before outputting requirements.
2. Acceptance criteria must be auto-generated by the Agent based on templates, split into testable module items.
3. Start writing `logs/workflow.log` from this phase.
4. If tests fail, execute “diagnose -> fix -> retest,” max 5 retries per point.
5. After UI confirmation, must generate draft UI files: `output/ui/ui-spec.md`, `output/ui/ui-tokens.json`, `output/ui/ui-quality-metrics.md`.
